                Hey, I'm Oli! I'm a front-end developer with a BA in Applied Media from Germany. With a
                strong technical background in front-end development and a keen eye for design from my studies, I help
                designers and companies turn their ideas into reality.
                When I'm not busy crafting awesome code, you might find me whipping up delicious meals, doing HIIT workouts,
                or exploring new corners of the world.
