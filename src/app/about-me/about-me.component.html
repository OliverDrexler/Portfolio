                Hey, I'm Oliver Drexler, but almost everyone I know calls me Oli - so feel free to call me the same. I'm a
                front-end developer based in Nuremberg, Germany. I help designers and companies to bring their ideas to life.
                When I'm not writing awesome code, you'll find me cooking, working out or traveling the world. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If you are convinced that i'd be a good match for your projects, feel free to hit that contact button and reach out to me!
